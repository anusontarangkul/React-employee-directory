## Installation

Click on the deployed [link](https://anusontarangkul.github.io/employee-directory/).

## Usage

To find an employee, you may enter their name in the search bar. As you type in the name, the search bar will filter employees who have those characters in their name. You can click the up arrow to organize the employees in an ascending order. You can click the down arrow to organize the employees in a descending order.

## Hightlights

![highlight](./highlight.png)

UseReducer was used to organize the state of the code. We have a case for ascending, descending, and the default organization of the employee directory.

## Learned

I learned more about React by integrating a search and filter feature in the app.
